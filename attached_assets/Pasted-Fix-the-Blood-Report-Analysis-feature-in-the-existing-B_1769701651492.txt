Fix the Blood Report Analysis feature in the existing BioPredict Flask application.

Current Issue:
- Only one parameter (platelet count) is being extracted and displayed.
- The system incorrectly shows “All extracted parameters are within standard reference ranges”.
- No proper risk classification or health suggestions are shown.

Required Fixes:

1. Parameter Extraction:
   - Define a fixed list of expected blood parameters:
     Hemoglobin, RBC, WBC, Platelet count, Fasting Glucose,
     Total Cholesterol, Triglycerides, Creatinine.
   - Implement loop-based extraction so ALL parameters present in the report
     are detected and parsed, not just one.
   - Support CSV files first (PDF/Image handling can be optional or future scope).

2. Reference Range Validation:
   - Define standard reference ranges for each parameter.
   - Compare extracted values against these ranges.
   - Classify each parameter as LOW, NORMAL, or HIGH.

3. Risk Mapping:
   - Map abnormal values to possible health risks
     (e.g., low hemoglobin → anemia risk,
            high glucose → diabetes risk,
            high cholesterol → heart disease risk).
   - Use risk wording such as “may indicate” or “possible risk”,
     not medical diagnosis.

4. Health Suggestions:
   - Add rule-based lifestyle and dietary suggestions for each detected risk.
   - Suggestions must be general and safe (no medical prescriptions).

5. Output Structure:
   - Return a structured JSON response containing:
     - Parameter name
     - Extracted value
     - Status (Low / Normal / High)
     - Possible risk
     - Health suggestion

6. UI Improvements:
   - Display each parameter in a separate card or table row.
   - Use color coding:
       Green = Normal,
       Yellow = Borderline,
       Red = High/Low risk.
   - Remove the global “All parameters are normal” message
     unless ALL extracted parameters truly fall within range.

7. Data Persistence:
   - Store extracted parameters and analysis results
     in the database linked to the logged-in user.

Constraints:
- Use Python Flask only.
- Do NOT use Node.js or React.
- Keep the analysis rule-based (no ML model required).
- Preserve existing diabetes prediction functionality.

Goal:
After the fix, uploading a valid blood report should show
multiple parameters with clear risk analysis and health suggestions,
not just platelet count.
